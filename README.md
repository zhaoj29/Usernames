# A work in progress...

Meant to take a user's username and password, hash the password and store it in a database. 

Driver.java = driver code for testing

User.java = all the underlying stuff for storing in a database. Uses SQL commands to update the data.

App.java = writing user info to a json file. 

When downloaded, will need to edit path and file names.
